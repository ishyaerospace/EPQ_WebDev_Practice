# JS syntax


## decleration of variables
`let x = 5;`
`let y = 6;`

to compute these variables
`let z = x + y;`

## javascript values
* literals = fixed values
* variable = variable values

    ### JS literals
    numbers are written with or without decimals
    strings are written with "" or ''

    ### JS variables
    `let` creates variables
    `const` creates a constant (keyword that does not change)

    ### rules for JS identifiers (variables/constants)
    * Must start with a letter, _, or $
    * Can contain digits after the first character
    * Cannot be a reserved keyword (let, const, if, etc.)
    * Are case-sensitive


## Javascript program

#### Note:
* if written in HTML, JavaScript programs are executed by the web browser
* Ending statements with semicolon is not required, but highly recommended.
